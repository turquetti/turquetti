# Gabriela Turquetti - Developer
My name is Gabriela, I'm a geophysicist working my way through code and I love challenges!<br><br>
My journey started in early 2020 when I was select to be a part of the course that changed my life "{reprograma} Front-End Development Bootcamp". It was an amazing experience during these 8 weeks, but now It has been a challenge to keep up with the same amont of study I used to have during the course. I spent the rest of the year studing OOP and now, at 2021, I finally got my hands dirty with React and Java (make sure to check my repositories learning both languages!).

**Current Challenges**: React and Java.
