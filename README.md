# Hi, I'm Gabriela! ðŸ‘»

I'm a developer and data enthusiast! ðŸ–¤

My tech journey started in early 2020 when I joined "{reprograma} Front-End Development Bootcamp". It was an amazing experience and after that, I never stopped to study! Now, in 2021, I joined the "VAMO AI", a 6-month program to develop 35 people to become Jr. Data Analysts. So now, my current challenges are:

- **6-month Data Analysis Course**: build applications with Python, MongoDB and Docker.
- **Ratas**: project designed to build an Art Gallery using Ghost, Gatsby and React applications.
