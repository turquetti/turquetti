# Gabriela Turquetti 
My name is Gabriela and I'm a geophysicist working my way through Front-End Development and I love challenges!<br>
This journey with Front-End Development started early 2020, but I finally got my hands dirty when I was select to be a part of the course that changed my life "{reprograma} Front-End Development Bootcamp". It was an amazing experience during these 8 weeks, but now It has been a challenge to keep up with the same amont of study I used to have during the course. So, to keep myself motivated, I decided to enroll to the #100DaysOfCode to get myself inspired and don't loose track of eveything I accomplished so far. My main goal with this challenge is to finally get my hands on JavaScript (feel free to check my progress on my repository), which has been the most difficult part of this journey.ðŸ’•
